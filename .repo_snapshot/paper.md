Git is widely adopted in modern software development for version control, enabling teams to track changes, manage code, and collaborate efficiently. A typical workflow involves writing code, committing discrete units of work, and synchronizing changes through push and pull operations. One of Gitâ€™s core strengths is its support for history traversal: developers can revert to a previous state of the codebase by checking out an earlier commit, making it an effective tool for debugging and regression analysis.

When a defect is introduced into the codebase, git bisect provides a binary search mechanism to identify the specific commit responsible for the failure. This process requires two inputs: a test or heuristic that can determine whether the current code state is functional, and a method for identifying failure states. The current heuritics is done via a binary search bisecting algorithm as the name suggests: 

Got it! Here's the **GitHub-flavored Markdown version** of the explanation with math rendered using LaTeX-style syntax inside code blocks (since GitHub doesn't support full LaTeX rendering natively, but people often use MathJax-style backticks or render it via tools like Jupyter or markdown extensions):

### ðŸ“˜ `git bisect` as Binary Search

Let  
```math
\mathcal{C} = \{c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n\}
```
be a totally ordered sequence of commits in time, where \( c_0 \) is the oldest and \( c_n \) is the most recent.

We define a predicate function:

```math
P: \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}
```

Where:

```math
P(c_i) = 
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } c_i \text{ is GOOD (functional)} \\
1 & \text{if } c_i \text{ is BAD (defective)}
\end{cases}
```

Assume there exists a unique index \( k \) such that:

```math
\forall j < k,\ P(c_j) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \forall j \geq k,\ P(c_j) = 1
```

The goal of `git bisect` is to identify the **transition point** \( c_k \), i.e., the first bad commit. This is done using binary search each iteration bisects the area of search by half. Gradually narrow down the first bad commit. It is mathmatically proven that bisecting will yield a solution and must work in O(n log n) runtime.

In practice, the boundary between a working and non-working state is often not binary. Many regressions exhibit flaky behaviorâ€”where errors appear intermittently rather than deterministically. We define the range between the last known-good commit and the first confirmed-bad commit as the flaky region, in which failures may not consistently reproduce. 

In practice, the predicate function \( P \) may behave as a **noisy or approximate oracle** due to:
- Flaky or non-deterministic tests
- Non-monotonic bug introductions and partial fixes
- Heuristic-based evaluations

Thus, \( P \) may not strictly satisfy the monotonicity assumption:

```math
\exists! \ c_k \text{ such that } \forall j < k,\ P(c_j)=0,\ \forall j \geq k,\ P(c_j)=1
```

To further complicate semantic similarity detection, many software projects engage in parallel development, wherein code fragments are derived or adapted from a common upstream repository but evolve independently in downstream forks. This phenomenon occurs when two systems share sufficiently similar functional goals, yet operate under significantly different architectural or contextual constraints. A canonical example of this is the relationship between Microsoft Edge and Google Chromium, where both browsers share a common codebase but diverge in platform integration, telemetry, and feature-specific adaptations.

- existing automatic problem locator often works on the same temporal domain meaning that it checks where in the current file at this point in time is the error. 

- the idea is check current plan then next plan then
